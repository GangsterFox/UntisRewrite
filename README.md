# UntisRewrite
A rewrite for the UntisAPI files I had

# To do
* clean up the code which is still kind of bad but I will rewrite it later down the line **done, kind of**
* another issue is that we dont have a lot of things to do with this api, I have no idea how to combat this except to add some other api wrapper

# Test.ts
* this is a test script written using async
* its faster when run than the students.js
