# UntisRewrite
A rewrite for the UntisAPI files I had

# What is this?
* These scripts use the WebUntis public API to scrape information about the school you are logged into
* Counting the different things and showing a console log of it (and also saves the received data into their respective json's)

# Difference between test and testFTS
* `test.js` was written quite a long time ago when I was still at the GBS
* `testFTS.js` was written once I started at my new school, FTS
* Code quality improved because I was quite stupid back then
